# KPI Recommendations

To track ticket sales effectiveness, I recommend the following KPIs:  

## 1. Conversion Rate (%)  

This KPI would help EventX:  
- Measure how effectively the platform converts interest into sales.  
- Identify potential drop-off points in the ticket-buying process.  

## 2. Sell-Through Rate (%)  

This KPI would help EventX:  
- Track inventory managementâ€”if events have unsold tickets, pricing & marketing may need adjustments.  
- Identify whether certain events have stronger demand.  

## 3. Time-to-Sell  

This KPI would help EventX:  
- Determine the ideal timing for ticket releases & promotions compared to the event start date.  
- Identify whether certain events have stronger demand.
